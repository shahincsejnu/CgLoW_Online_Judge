At a certain laboratory results of secret research are thoroughly encrypted. A result of a single experiment is stored as an information of its completion:

‘positive result’, ‘negative result’, ‘experiment failed’ or ‘experiment not completed’

The encrypted result constitutes a string of digits S, which may take one of the following forms:

• positive result S = 1 or S = 4 or S = 78
• negative result S = S35
• experiment failed S = 9S4
• experiment not completed S = 190S

(A sample result S35 means that if we add digits 35 from the right hand side to a digit sequence then we shall get the digit sequence corresponding to a failed experiment)

You are to write a program which decrypts given sequences of digits.


<h4> Input </h4>
A integer n stating the number of encrypted results and then consecutive n lines, each containing a sequence of digits given as ASCII strings.

<h4> Output </h4>

For each analysed sequence of digits the following lines should be sent to output (in separate lines):

+ for a positive result
- for a negative result
* for a failed experiment
? for a not completed experiment

In case the analysed string does not determine the experiment result, a first match from the above list should be outputted.

<h4> Sample Input </h4>

4
78
7835
19078
944

<h4> Sample Output </h4>

+
-
?
*
